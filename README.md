# Make things count

**Make things count** is a personnal web developement project. One can consider it  
like a piece of art and / or a show off of my web developement skills.

This project involves the usage of several web technologies such as :
- HTML5 Boilerplate
- Plain vanilla JavaScript
- AJAX
- Some CSS3
- Git versioning

Please feel free to reach me for any project related questions, I'll be glad  
sharing / learning some tips and tricks !
